Roman numerals are represented by: <b>I</b>, <b>V</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b> and <b>M</b>.<br>
Examples: XX = 20, III = 3, XXVII = 27, XV=15, XL = 40.<br><br>
II is 2, III is 3 but the numeral for four is not IIII, the number four is written as IV. <br>
The one is before the five we subtract it making four. <br>
The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. <br>
There are six instances where subtraction is used:<br>
I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. <br>
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.<br>
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.<br>
